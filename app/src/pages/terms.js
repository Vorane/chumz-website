								<strong>How to earn a referral credit</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								From time to time existing Chumz users can earn
								a referral credit of a given amount towards a
								qualifying transaction if a friend and new Chumz
								user clicks on the unique referral link, or
								enters the unique referral code upon
								registration, and completes a qualifying
								transaction on the Chumz platform. There’s no
								limit to the number of referrals that each user
								can send or the number of referral credits they
								can earn, but only one referral code can be used
								per qualifying transaction. Referral codes can’t
								be used in combination with any other promotion
								code.
							</p>
							<h2 id='-what-is-a-qualifying-transaction-'>
								<strong>
									What is a qualifying transaction?
								</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								A qualifying transaction must have a total
								saving value* of at least Kes 5000 for saving
								and, it must be their first transaction. If the
								first transaction of the user is less than the
								qualifying amount, the referral code can be used
								in a subsequent transaction with the same or
								higher total sending value as the qualifying
								amount. There is no expiry date on the referral
								code.
							</p>
							<h2 id='-how-to-share-referral-codes-'>
								<strong>How to share referral codes</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								Referral codes should only be shared with people
								the user knows personally and should be shared
								on a platform where there’s a reasonable basis
								that the people are personal friends. Chumz
								reserves the right to deny the referral amounts
								if there’s suspicion of manipulation of the
								referral scheme, such as creating duplicate
								accounts with different contact details, sharing
								in unsolicited ways (spam) and anything else
								that Chumz deems to be not in good faith,
								abusive and a breach of this agreement.
							</p>
							<h2 id='-liability-and-governing-law-'>
								<strong>Liability and governing law</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								These terms and conditions are in accordance
								with the laws of Kenya, and Chumz reserves the
								right to change these terms and conditions and
								to terminate the referral scheme at any point in
								time. Chumz also accepts no liability for any
								use of the referral programme that doesn’t
								comply with this agreement.
