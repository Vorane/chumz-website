								<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
							</h1>
							<p>
								This Privacy Policy explains how Chumz uses your
								Personal Data collected or processed from you in
								providing a savings app facility for saving
								money for self or others (“Service”).
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Collecting Personal Data- What we collect
									and Use
								</strong>
							</p>
							<p>Chumz collects data in two ways:</p>
							<p>
								1) The data you submit when you register in the
								application. This data is composed of personally
								identifiable information such as: Identification
								number, date of birth, phone number, gender and
								age
							</p>
							<p>
								2) Data collected through the app permissions:
								Chumz requests the user to give the app
								permission to enable access of the users contact
								list and messages. Once the permissions are
								given the app is able to collect contact list
								information. This information enables a better
								user experience in inviting members to the app
								from a central service the app can access with
								your data and the messages enables the app
								advise you on how to invest based on your
								spending habits
							</p>
							<p>
								( You can check the section on how we use your
								personal data under this Privacy Policy to get
								more information on how the data is used)
							</p>
							<h2 id='-processing-your-personal-data-'>
								<strong>Processing your Personal Data</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								Chumz processes the data and stores it in Google
								cloud servers. The Google cloud services offer
								us hosting solutions to enable processing of the
								data and storing of the information generated
								from the data.
							</p>
							<p>
								We also use third party data analysis tool
								called metabase to assist in data analytics of
								the users data
							</p>
							<h2 id='-information-collection-and-use-'>
								<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								For a better experience, while using our
								Service, we may require you to provide us with
								your contact list information, messages and
								transaction data. The information that we
								request will be retained by us and used as
								described in this privacy policy.
							</p>
							<p>
								The app does use third party services that may
								collect information used to identify you or to
								enable a better experience.
							</p>
							<h2 id='-how-we-use-your-personal-data-'>
								<strong>How we use your Personal Data</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								Contact list information: We request permission
								to access your contact list information to
								enable you to invite friends and family to join
								your financial investment groups from the app to
								your phone-book contact list. By clicking invite
								a member from the app a link is sent to the
								person to join your group via the contact list
								permission you have authorized. You can opt-in
								or opt-out of the contact list information
								access feature.
							</p>
							<p>
								Messages: To enable Chumz guide and advise you
								on how to save based on your mobile money
								financial transactions. This option can be
								switched on and off in the app
							</p>
							<p>
								Chumz uses Personal Data to communicate with you
								and to administer, deliver, improve and
								personalize the Service. Chumz might also
								generate generic data out of any Personal Data
								we collect and use it for our own purposes.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may also use such data to communicate with
								you in relation to other products or services
								offered by Chumz or its partners. Chumz may
								request that you confirm your consent to receive
								such communications (‘opt-in’) or to indicate
								that you would not like to receive such
								communications or that they should be
								discontinued (‘opt-out’). Where you opt-out,
								Chumz will not use your Personal Data for direct
								marketing.
							</p>
							<p>
								We do not share your Personal Data with third
								parties (other than partners in connection with
								their services to Chumz) except where you have
								given your consent.
							</p>
							<h2 id='-sharing-your-personal-data-'>
								<strong>Sharing your Personal Data</strong>
							</h2>
							<p>
								We may share your Personal Data with third
								parties:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									If we think that sharing is necessary to
									enforce the terms of a contract with you or
									to protect the rights, property or safety of
									Chumz or the services provided by Chumz.
								</li>
								<li>
									To enable us to comply with the law or to
									satisfy a legitimate government request or
									an order of any court of competent
									jurisdiction or any regulatory authority or,
									if necessary, to defend Chumz or its
									Subscribers (for example, in a lawsuit).
								</li>
								<li>
									In connection with the sale or transfer of
									our business or any part thereof.
								</li>
								<li>
									If you request a service or product that is
									administered by a third party, in order to
									allow us to respond to the request. If such
									a third party is working for Chumz it may
									also send back to Chumz any new information
									obtained from you.
								</li>
								<li>
									To allow us to cooperate with law
									enforcement agencies to identify anyone who
									uses our Service for illegal activities. We
									reserve the right to report to law
									enforcement agencies any activities that we
									believe are unlawful including exchanging
									information with other companies,
									organisations and agencies for the purposes
									of fraud protection.
								</li>
								<li>
									To third parties who provide services to
									Chumz (such as administration or technical
									services). However we ensure that such
									partners do not use Personal Data for any
									other purposes, do not disclose it to anyone
									else and that they do not retain copies
									except as necessary to provide services to
									us or as required by law.
								</li>

								potentially affected. In this event we will
								contact you via email, in-Service messaging or
								publication on Chumz’s website. We reserve the
								right to delay notification if it is asked to do
								so by law enforcement or other authorities, or
								if giving notice immediately will increase the
								risk of harm to end-users overall.
