            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy explains how Chumz uses your Personal Data
              collected or processed from you in providing a savings app
              facility for saving money for self or others (“Service”).
            </p>

            <h2>Who processes your Personal Data?</h2>
            <p>
              Chumz processes and stores Personal Data collected from you via
              your use of the Service or where you have given your consent.
            </p>

            <h2>We might ask you to provide us with Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
              Chumz may request that you provide Personal Data when offering the
              Service to you. This Personal Data may include contact details,
              copies of identification documentation derived from publicly
              accessible databases, your national identity number as well as
              information relating to your device or Internet service (such as
              an IP address and a MAC number).
            </p>

            <h2>How we use your Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
              Chumz uses Personal Data to communicate with you and to
              administer, deliver, improve and personalize the Service. Chumz
              might also generate generic data out of any Personal Data we
              collect and use it for our own purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may also use such data to communicate with you in relation to
              other products or services offered by Chumz or its partners. Chumz
              may request that you confirm your consent to receive such
              communications (‘opt-in’) or to indicate that you would not like
              to receive such communications or that they should be discontinued
              (‘opt-out’). Where you opt-out, Chumz will not use your Personal
              Data for direct marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not share your Personal Data with third parties (other than
              partners in connection with their services to Chumz) except where
              you have given your consent.
            </p>

            <h2>Sharing your Personal Data</h2>
            <p>We may share your Personal Data with third parties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If we think that sharing it is necessary to enforce the terms of
                a contract with you or to protect the rights, property or safety
                of Chumz or the services provided by Chumz.
              </li>
              <li>
                To enable us to comply with the law or to satisfy a legitimate
                government request or an order of any court of competent
                jurisdiction or any regulatory authority or, if necessary, to
                defend Chumz or its Subscribers (for example, in a lawsuit).
              </li>
              <li>
                In connection with the sale or transfer of our business or any
                part thereof.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you request a service or product that is administered by a
                third party, in order to allow us to respond to the request. If
                such third party is working for Chumz it may also send back to
                Chumz any new information obtained from you.
              </li>
              <li>
                To allow us to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to
                identify anyone who uses our Service for illegal activities. We
                reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
                activities that we believe are unlawful including exchanging
                information with other companies, organisations and agencies for
                the purposes of fraud protection.
              </li>
              <li>
                To third parties who provide services to Chumz (such as such as
                administration or technical services). However we ensure that
                such partners do not use Personal Data for any other purposes,
                do not disclose it to anyone else and that they do not retain
                copies except as necessary to provide services to us or as
                required by law.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Storage, security and retention of your Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
              Personal Data that we collect is stored on our servers which may
              be located outside Kenya and may also be processed by staff
              operating outside the Kenya. We implement and maintain the highest
              levels of security to protect any information stored on our
              servers and to comply with all local rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is your responsibility to keep your password secure. You should
              also be aware that the transmission of information via the
              Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to
              protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of
              Personal Data transmitted to our site outside our control.
            </p>
            <p>
              We strive to collect no more Personal Data than is required. This
              helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach
              in security occur.
            </p>

            <h1>Notification in the event of breach</h1>
            <p>
              It would be very unlikely, but if a breach in the security of
              Personal Data were to occur, we will notify you if you are
              actually or potentially affected. In this event we will contact
              you via email, in-Service messaging or publication on Chumz’s
              website. We reserve the right to delay notification if it is asked
              to do so by law enforcement or other authorities, or if giving
              notice immediately will increase the risk of harm to end-users
              overall.
            </p>

            <h1>Privacy Policy changes</h1>
            <p>
              Chumz may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the
              revised policy on its app and website. Any changes will become

            </p>

            <h1>Cookies</h1>
            <p>
              We may use cookies to, amongst other things, gather and retain
              information about a Subscriber’s use of the Service to enable them
              to move between features of the Service and help us build an
              ongoing picture of Subscribers’ needs and preferences so that we
              can tailor future visits to the Service and improve a Subscriber’s
              experience of the Service. Additionally, we may use a third party
              to analyse our Subscribers’ experiences of the Service. To do
              that, those third parties will place a pixel on the app or a
              cookie for a web browser. Cookies can be disabled by changing your
              browser settings. Please note that the Service may not operate
              properly or features may not be available to you if you disable
              cookies.
